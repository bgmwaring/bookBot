Book Bot is a python command line program that takes a text file as input and details its word and character counts. This project was mainly intended as practice as its function is not novel.

### Status
Although this is a completed project, I will be looking to move the UI away from command line at some point in the future.

## Installation

This repo can be cloned directly to your device.

## Usage

Create a text document in the directory of main.py, and make sure the file name in main.py matches that of your text document. Main.py can then be run on your command line.

## Contributing

This program is complete but feel free to raise any issues.
