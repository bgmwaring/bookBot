Book Bot is a python program that takes a text file as input and details its word and character counts. This project was mainly intended as practice as its function is not novel. Currently Book Bot runs on a Gooey produced GUI.

### Status
This is a completed project but I am currently using it to learn how PyPI and python publishing works.

## Installation

This repo can be cloned directly to your device. It uses Gooey library so this will need to be installed.
```
pip install Gooey
```

## Usage

Run main.py and the Gooey interface will prompt you to select a text file. The program will then output details of this text, including words count and individual character counts.

## Contributing

This program is complete but feel free to raise any issues.
